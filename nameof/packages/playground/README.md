# TypeScript `nameof` Playground
A project for testing the functionality of the `nameof` plugin.

Feel free to try out TypeScript `nameof` by running one of the following commands:

```sh
npm run test:ts-patch
npm run test:ttsc
npm run test:webpack
npm run test:ts-jest
npm run test:babel-plugin
npm run test:babel-macro
```

You can then edit the example files in `./scr/test` to see how files are transformed or errors regarding incorrect syntax are reported.

The transformed and compiled files can be found in the `./out` directory.
